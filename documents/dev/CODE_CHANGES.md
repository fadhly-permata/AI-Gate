# Code Changes Register (code ↔ docs alignment)

**Purpose.** Every source-code change is logged here **per file** so the code and
the project documents never drift apart ("align"). This is the audit trail that
ties a running change back to the spec it implements.

**Rule.** Maintained per `pm/OPERATING_RULES.md` **R22** — PM records each
verified code change here (newest section on top). Changes are logged AFTER they
are verified (tests run), not before. Environment tweaks outside the repo are
noted under "Environment (outside repo)". Not-yet-done work is marked **PENDING**
and completed when it lands.

## 2026-09-05 — Terminal toolbar: Keep Screen On + Fullscreen/Paste dropdowns — DONE ✅

**Goal.** Three terminal-toolbar features: (1) a **Keep Screen On** toggle using
the Screen Wake Lock API so the tablet doesn't sleep mid-session (prevents the tab
freeze that drops the WS); (2) the **Fullscreen** button becomes a split-dropdown —
default stays "Full Page" (CSS), menu adds TRUE fullscreen (`requestFullscreen`,
F11-style); (3) the **Paste** button becomes a split-dropdown — default stays
normal paste, menu adds "Paste as Code Block" (wrap clipboard in a fenced block).

**Process note.** Two `fe-dev` spawns were interrupted by the flaky connection, but
the diffs landed (verified via markers + `git diff`). PM reviewed the code
line-by-line. A lingering `fe-dev` run (still alive after its receipt was cut) then
fixed the regex-literal typos (a missing closing `/` in `[^}]*\}` → `[^}]*\}/`) that
had desynced the esbuild/node lexer, and restored the "Dropdown CSS contract" block.
PM re-verified: the test file is now stable (md5 unchanged across checks, 0 live
writers). Feature tests authored by `fe-dev` (60 tests).

### `src/frontend/static/terminal.js` (+589, combined with the tab-id work below)
- **Keep Screen On:** `wakeLockSupported(nav)` (secure-context feature-detect),
  state `keepAwake={desired,sentinel,supported}`, `acquireKeepAwake()`,
  `releaseKeepAwakeSentinel()`, `toggleKeepAwake()`, `renderKeepAwake()` (disabled
  render when unsupported), `onVisibilityKeepAwake()` (re-acquire on return),
  `setupKeepAwake()`; intent persisted in `sessionStorage` key
  `aigate.term.keepAwake`.
- **True Fullscreen:** `fsElement()`, `fsSupported()`, `fsCall()`,
  `toggleTrueFullscreen()` (carries the full-page class while in, rolls back on
  exit via `fsRollbackCarried()`), `onFullscreenChange()`, `syncFullscreenMenu()`.
- **Paste as Code Block:** `wrapCodeBlock(text)` wraps the clipboard text between
  two triple-backtick fences with newlines — verbatim, NO added indentation, NO
  trailing newline; `pasteAsCodeBlock()`.
- **Shared dropdown:** `createTermMenu(caret,menu)` (tap-to-open, one-at-a-time,
  tap-outside + Esc + arrow-key focus, idempotent per node), `onDocTapClose`,
  `bindOnce`, `setupControlMenus()`.
- **Defaults preserved:** main `#termFullscreen` → `toggleFullscreen` (full page);
  main `#termPaste` → `pasteActive` (normal).
- **Exports:** test hooks added (`wrapCodeBlock`, `wakeLockSupported`, `_keepAwake`,
  `_toggleKeepAwake`, `_setupKeepAwake`, `_onVisibilityKeepAwake`,
  `_toggleFullscreen`, `_toggleTrueFullscreen`, `_onFullscreenChange`,
  `_fsSupported`, `_fsCarriedFullPage`, `_pasteActive`, `_pasteAsCodeBlock`,
  `_createTermMenu`, `_setupControlMenus`, `_openMenu`).

### `src/frontend/static/index.html` (+61)
- New `#termKeepAwake` toggle button; Fullscreen + Paste converted to split buttons
  with carets (`#termFullscreenCaret`/`#termPasteCaret`) and popover menus
  (`#termFullscreenMenu` → `#termMenuFullPage`/`#termMenuFullscreen`;
  `#termPasteMenu` → `#termMenuPaste`/`#termMenuPasteCode`), with
  `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded`/`role=menu`/`menuitemcheckbox`.

### `src/frontend/static/i18n.js` (+22)
- EN + ID keys: `term.full_page`, `term.exit_full_page`,
  `term.fullscreen_unsupported`, `term.fullscreen_menu`, `term.paste_code`,
  `term.keep_awake`, `term.keep_awake_on/off/unsupported/error`.

### `src/frontend/static/styles.css` (+92)
- `.term-split`, `.term-caret`, `.term-menu` (absolute popover, `pointer-events:auto`,
  z-index above the stage), `.term-menu-item` (≥40px touch target), checked +
  disabled states.

### `src/frontend/tests/terminal_toolbar.test.js` (NEW, 60 tests)
- wrapCodeBlock exact string; keep-awake feature-detect + acquire/release/
  re-acquire + disabled-when-unsupported; full-page default toggle; true-fullscreen
  enter/exit + fullscreenchange sync/rollback; paste normal vs fenced (exact);
  dropdown open/close (tap, outside, Esc).
- Includes a "Dropdown CSS contract" block (7 tests) — initially broken by a
  missing regex-closing `/` (lexer desync), fixed by the lingering `fe-dev` run.

### Verification (real, run in this env)
- `node --check src/frontend/static/terminal.js` → OK.
- `cd src/frontend && node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` → **21 files /
  390 tests passed** (330 prior + 60 new; no regression).
- **Not yet exercised in a real Chrome on the tablet** (R20 gap): wake-lock
  (needs http://localhost or HTTPS), true fullscreen, and the paste fence must be
  confirmed manually.

## 2026-09-05 — Terminal session persistence (survive Chrome tab DISCARD) — DONE ✅

**Goal.** The aigate web terminal survived a Chrome tab FREEZE (reconnect reuses
the in-memory `tab_id`) but LOST the session on a tab DISCARD: the renderer is
killed, the page reloads, and `openTab()` minted a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` →
the backend treated it as a new session → fresh shell + orphaned PTY. Fix =
persist the terminal tab id(s) client-side so a reload REATTACHES to the same
backend PTY.

**Backend contract (unchanged, referenced for alignment).** WS
`/ws/terminal/{tab_id}`; the RAW `tab_id` string is the registry key; reconnect
with the SAME id reattaches + replays the ring buffer; a NEW id spawns a fresh
shell; disconnect ≠ kill (PTY survives up to `terminal_idle_reap_minutes`,
default 60); only `{"type":"close"}` kills. No backend file was touched.

### `src/frontend/static/terminal.js` (+123 / −18)
- **NEW persistence block (L46–102):** `TAB_IDS_KEY="aigate.term.tabIds"`,
  `readSavedTabIds()`, `writeSavedTabIds()`, `addSavedTabId()`,
  `removeSavedTabId()`, `mintTabId()`. Uses **`sessionStorage`** (per-tab;
  survives same-tab reload/discard-restore) — deliberately NOT `localStorage`
  (shared across browser tabs → two aigate tabs would collide on one PTY key).
- **`openTab(id)` (L451):** now takes an OPTIONAL id — reuses a given id
  (reattach), else mints a new one. Non-string arg (a click `Event`) is treated
  as "no id". Double-open guard: a live id → `activate(id)` + return existing.
  Registers the id via `addSavedTabId`. Returned tab shape unchanged.
- **`restoreTabs()` (NEW, L514):** opens one tab per saved id; returns true if
  ≥1 tab restored.
- **`closeTab(id)` (L590):** calls `removeSavedTabId(id)` (L616) AFTER
  `tabs.delete(id)` and BEFORE the last-tab `openTab()`, so a deliberately closed
  tab is never resurrected on reload and the replacement id is persisted.
- **`init()` (L828):** `newTabBtn` / `emptyNewTabBtn` click handlers wrapped so
  the click `Event` is never read as a tab id.
- **`onShow` (L909):** `if (activeId) refitActive(); else if (!restoreTabs()) openTab();`
  — restore-if-present, else first-load behavior. Lazy (no PTY/WS spawned for a
  user who never opens the Terminal view).
- **exports (L928):** added `_TAB_IDS_KEY`, `_readSavedTabIds`, `_restoreTabs`,
  `_mintTabId` (test/introspection hooks).
- **Untouched (verified):** WS protocol, `wireSocket`, `connectSocket`,
  `scheduleReconnect`, `checkLiveness`/`armLiveness`, ping/pong heartbeat,
  backoff, resize, close-frame, swipe/inertia, `launchInNewTab`.

### `src/frontend/tests/terminal_discard.test.js` (NEW, 16 tests)
Harness uses `vi.resetModules()` + re-import per test to simulate a real page
reload (fresh `tabs` Map + `activeId`). Covers:
- (a) `openTab()` persists its minted id; accumulates ids in order, deduped;
  `openTab(id)` reuses the given id; non-string arg still mints fresh.
- (b) restore opens the WS with the PERSISTED id (not a fresh uuid); does not
  also open a fresh tab; idempotent; empty/absent behaves like first load;
  corrupt stored values ignored; a restored tab keeps the FREEZE reattach path.
- (c) `closeTab(id)` removes exactly that id; keeps the "≥1 tab" invariant and
  persists the replacement; a user-closed tab is never resurrected by a reload.
- (d) `openTab()` returns a working tab when `sessionStorage` throws; a failing
  `setItem` (quota) still opens a working tab; without storage, behaves as before.

### Verification (real, run in this env)
- `node --check src/frontend/static/terminal.js` → OK.
- `cd src/frontend && node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` → **20 files /
  330 tests passed** (incl. `terminal_discard` 16, `terminal_reconnect` 24 — no
  regression). Re-run by PM independently.
- **Not yet exercised end-to-end in a real Chrome discard** (R20 gap) — the
  discard→reload reattach must be confirmed manually on the tablet.

### Environment (outside repo)
- `~/.bashrc` — added an idempotent `termux-wake-lock` auto-acquire block so the
  Termux-hosted aigate server (and its terminal PTYs) are not frozen by Android
  doze when the tablet screen is off. No package installed (binary already
  present). Wake lock also acquired live in the current session (exit 0).
